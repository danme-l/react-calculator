# Free Code Camp - Calculator
The Fourth Project from the Front End Development Libraries Cert in the [Free Code Camp Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). This is an extremely simple calculator app but the constraints from Free Code Camp (found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator)) were tough - especially number 13:

> User Story #13: If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-) sign). For example, if 5 + * 7 = is entered, the result should be 35 (i.e. 5 * 7); if 5 * - 5 = is entered, the result should be -25 (i.e. 5 * (-5)).

Done with React. I'd like to go back and make the Buttons Container it's own functional component and pass the methods for the calculator functionality in as props, because the way it currently is is kind of a mess; but that's for another time.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
